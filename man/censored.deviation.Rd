\title{Impute censored cases to rebuild longer epidemic vector}
\description{When first records of incidence are unavailable, tries to impute censored cases to rebuild longer epidemic vector}
\usage{censored.deviation(optim.vect, epid, R0, GT)}
\arguments{
  \item{optim.vect}{Vector of two elements (multiplicative factor, log(highest imputed data) correspondig to initial values}
  \item{epid}{Original epidemic vector, output of check.incid()}
  \item{R0}{Assumed R0 value for the original epidemic vector}
  \item{GT}{Generation time distribution to be used for computations}
}
\details{For internal use. Called by impute.incid.

This function is not intended for stand-alone use. It computes the difference between theoretical
incidence and observed epidemics, for a given vector of initial values. 
To find the find best-fitting incidence values, this same vector must be optimized, to minimize the
value returned by SCE}
\value{The deviation between sum((E(Nt)-Nt)^2)}
