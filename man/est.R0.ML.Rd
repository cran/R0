White & Pagano (2009) detail two maximum likelihood methods for estimatig the reproduction ratio.
The first (and used by default in this package) assumes that the serial interval distirbution is known, and subsequently
the likelihood is only maximised depending on the value of R.
The second method can be used if the serial interval distribution is unknown: in that case, the generation time is set to
follow a Gamma distribution with two parameters (size, shape), and the optimization routine finds the values of R, size and shape
that maximize the likelihood. However, the epidemic curve must be long enough to account for a whole generation. The authors showed
that this is achieved when the cumulated amount of incident cases reaches 150. 
When using this method, the flag \code{unknown.GT} must be set to \code{TRUE}. GT must still be provided with a R0.GT-class object, however its mean and sd will be recycled as starting value for the optimization routine.

The principle of the methods described by White & all is to compute the expected number of 
cases in the future, and optimise to get R using a Poisson distribution.

CI is achieved by profiling the likelihood.}
